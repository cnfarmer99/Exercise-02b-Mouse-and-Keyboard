Test it and make sure this is working correctly. The get_input function is probably a good snippet to add to your gists.

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, you should now see the updated files listed in the left panel. In the bottom of that panel, type a Summary message (something like "Completes the mouse and keyboard exercise") and press the "Commit to master" button.

If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-02b-Mouse-and-Keyboard) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
